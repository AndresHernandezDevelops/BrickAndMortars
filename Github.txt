2. type 
      git add -A
  there is 3 stages locally, this command adds all the files you have edditted from stage 1 to stage 2, if you want to check this worked  you can type "git status" and these files will appear in green color instead of red

      git commit -m "message telling your teammates what code functionality you implemented"
  this command adds all files from stage 2 to 3 (3 is your local master)
